# Curtains

I am sick and tired of the theatre industry living in the past. The productions are masturbatory and are way too much about self-expression and not enough about what the AUDIENCE wants. Curtains is my proposed solution. Let the audience tell you what works and what doesn't, and let the companies see for themselves what they should be creating to affect and bring in audiences. I'm also sick of hearing people in the Bay Area say they don't know what theatres there are, or what productions are good. Let's build something that takes care of all of that!

Curtains currently allows users to log in and vote on current theatrical productions in the Bay Area. There is an example seed now of upcoming productions for Golden Thread's ReOrient Festival, in which I am performing.

The future:

Theatre companies will submit their own performance information, much like Yelp, and receive feedback from patrons.
Patrons can create critic profiles or vote as guests.
Logged in members will be able to leave full criticisms and upvote or downvote others' criticisms of productions.
Up/Downvote restrictions will include:
  -No summaries, leave an opinion
  -No spoilers
  -Coverage of specific criteria (acting, design, etc. TBA)

An application has been filed to access Goldstar's API for existing ticketing and production information that will aid in the development of this application.
